# SoftC

SoftC is a library for C/C++ built with 6500+ lines of code. It has a bunch of functions that you can use to make your work easier, and create complex data structures like Vector, List, Dictionary without limitations. With the power of nesting, you can do a lot, and store data effortlessly and access them easily. In The Documentation.pdf, I defined them all with complete details that I think will be necessary, Each data structure has its advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed in their chapters.

## Idea Behind SoftC

You might be wondering why C? When i first started programming, C seems old and useless to me, but when i took CS50 Introduction to Computer Science, i learned about C, i study it more. I read a book (which i borrow from my uncle) “Waite Group’s Turbo C Programming For The PC and Turbo C++”  and i just fell in love with it. I already knew Python, JS, Dart, Php but C really impressed me with it’s power, performance,Memory Control, Pointers, freedom to allocate memory and many more. After that when i start C++, to be honest i didn’t like that (it’s personally it Didn’t mean that it’s bad at all, it has a large community and is very popular). Because i had to remember lots of things and i’m very bad at remembering, C Seems to much more simple, faster and it can do everything than any Other languages, it just requires more effort. So why not make something that makes C Easy to program. So here it is, Without any further due let’s Get right into it.

## How to Use?

There's a book in this repository name as Documentation.pdf, it has complete details with all functions which you can use to work with this library.
