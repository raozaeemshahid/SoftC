# SoftC

SoftC is a library for C/C++ built with 6500+ lines of code. It has a bunch of functions that you can use to make your work easier, and create complex data structures like Vector, List, Dictionary without limitations. With the power of nesting, you can do a lot, and store data effortlessly and access them easily. In The Documentation.pdf, I defined them all with complete details that I think will be necessary, Each data structure has its advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed in their chapters.

## Idea Behind SoftC

You might be wondering why C? When I first started programming, C seems
old and expired to me, but when I took CS50 Introduction to Computer Science on
Edx by Harvard University, thanks to Prof David J. Malan that it was available for
free, I learned about C. I read a book (which I borrow from my uncle) “Waite
Group’s Turbo C Programming For The PC and Turbo C++” by Robert Lafore,
and I just fell in love with it. I already knew Python, JavaScript, Dart, PHP but C
impressed me with its power, performance, Memory Control, Pointers, freedom to
allocate memory, and many more. After that when I start C++, to be honest, I
didn’t like that (it didn’t mean that it’s bad at all, it has a large community and is
very popular). it's Because I had to remember lots of things, understanding it's
architecture is harder for me, C Seems pretty simple, faster, it only takes more
effort. So why not make something that makes C Easy to program, first it was
personal, then I decided to make this library free and share with everyone, so
Without any further due let’s get right into it.

## How to Use?

There's a book in this repository name as Documentation.pdf, it has complete details with all functions which you can use to work with this library.
